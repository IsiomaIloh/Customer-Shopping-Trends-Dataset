1. DEMOGRAPHIC ANALYSIS RESULTS:

B. Using the Pearson correlation coefficient to measure the linear relationship between 'Age' and 'Purchase Amount (USD)'

First, it is good to note that the Pearson correlation coefficient measures the linear relationship between two quantitative variables.
It ranges from -1 to 1:

- 1 indicates a perfect positive linear relationship: As one variable increases, the other variable also increases proportionally.
- -1 indicates a perfect negative linear relationship: As one variable increases, the other variable decreases proportionally.
- 0 indicates no linear relationship between the variables.

In this case, the Pearson correlation coefficient between Age and APurchase Amount (USD) is approximately -0.0104,
this indicates a very weak negative linear relationship between the 'Age' and 'Purchase Amount (USD)' variables.
This means that there is a slight tendency for the purchase amount to decrease slightly as age increases,
but the relationship is extremely weak.

It's important to note that correlation does not imply causation.
Even though there may be a correlation between age and purchase amount,
it does not necessarily mean that age directly influences purchase amount.
Other factors may also play a role, and further analysis would be needed to
understand the underlying reasons for the observed relationship.

C. Using a T_Statistic test to measure the relationship between 'Age' and 'Purchase Amount (USD)'
The T_Statistic test is used to determine if there is a significant difference between the means of two groups.
The T-Statistics calculated is -0.877, which suggests that the difference between the  means of the Purchasing Amount(USD)
for Male and Female customers is relatively small. The negative sign indicates that an average male customer may have slightly
lower purchase amount than female customers.

This is further supported by the p-value of 0.381, which indicates that there is a 38.1% chance of observing such a difference in
purchase amount between male and female customers due to random chance alone. This is higher than the commonly used significance level of 0.05.
Therefore, based on the t-test results, we do not find strong evidence to suggest a significant difference in purchase amounts between male and female customers
