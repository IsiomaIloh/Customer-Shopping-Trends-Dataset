2. Correlation between Age, Gender, and Purchase Amount:
- Use scatter plots or box plots to visualize the relationship between age, gender, and purchase amount.
- Calculate correlation coefficients (e.g., Pearson correlation
coefficient) to quantify the strength and direction of the relationship
between variables.
- Use statistical tests (e.g., t-test or ANOVA) to determine if there
are significant differences in purchase amount between different age
groups and genders.

3. Differences in Shopping Behavior between Male and Female Customers:
- Compare purchase amounts between male and female customers using box plots or violin plots.
- Conduct hypothesis tests (e.g., t-test or Mann-Whitney U test) to determine if there are significant differences in shopping behavior between male and female customers.
- Explore additional variables such as product categories or shopping frequency to further analyze differences in shopping behavior.
